# Here's Your Fuckin' Papers

## In Brief

*Here's Your Fuckin' Papers* is like *Papers, Please* from the other side of the counter: as the poor hapless person having to keep up with visa requirements to enter any country. Through minigames and ever-changing requirements the player gets a sense of the arduousness of the visa process - one faced by many populations worldwide without much attention or understanding.

## Background

The visa process is long, arduous, and pointless in a lot of ways. You get asked tons of invasive and pointless questions (such as "have you ever committed a genocide?") that don't seem to have any relationship to reality. You have to fulfil arbitrary requirements (that change randomly all the time), have to keep up with mounds of paperwork, and have to pay time, money, and sanity to get it all together. 

And then, even if you do fulfill all the requirements, you still may not get approved.

Trying to explain the sheer headache of this process is difficult: if you've never had to face it - especially if you come from a country and background [where you don't really need a visa to travel most places](http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/files/20140418/VISA_Index_2014_04_11_Web.pdf) - you wouldn't necessarily understand. Yet if you're not alert and prepared, [you could get into serious trouble](http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2012/11/21/plan-before-you-travel-without-a-visa-you-might-need-to-stay-home/) - and for some people this risk is too much. Some of us can't just pack up our bags and hop on a plane: we have to [make some complicated calculations](http://www.visamapper.com/) based on who we are, where we're from, where we're going, why we're going, and what we've done.

## Comparison to *Papers, Please*

The closest game (or overall pop cultural artifact) that has presented the visa conundrum is the acclaimed indie game *Papers, Please*, where the player works as an Immigration officer that has to cross-check passports, IDs, and entry permits against the ever-changing regulations of a Soviet-esque country. Throughout the game people attempt to enter the country through legitimate, plainly false, or questionable means: fake passports, unclear names and genders, forged permits, pleas of being let in as refugees. The game adds another element of stress: the number of passports processed each game-day affects the amount of take-home pay, which goes towards food, heating, rent, and medicine for the officer's family.

*Papers, Please* does give a very good sense of the overwhelming feeling of keeping up with entry requirements, and demonstrates the various ways and reasons people migrate. However, its focus is on the Immigration official, working on behalf of The Man, who does not reward you for compassion or mercy but rather for how closely you follow the rules. 

One of our team members (Creatrix Tiara), who has dealt with a lifetime of immigration bureaucracy, felt that the game both cut too close to home and forced her to sympathize with an entity that usually has given her much grief and harm. *Here's Your Fuckin' Papers*, created at the GXDev Game Jam 2015, is an attempt at portraying what it feels like to be on the other side of the counter - a side Tiara knows all too well.

## Gameplay Structure

The game has a few phases:

* The entry interview
* The escort game, with minigame checkpoints
* The final approval or denial process

Along the way random factors either based on the input of the player (stretch goal) or chosen by the computer affect the gameplay options as well as the final result. There is also an option to "expedite" the visa process monetarily.

### Entry Interview

The entry interview starts off with the player being asked for the name, gender, and country of origin. All answers are open-ended. Sometimes the player is given follow-up questions where the bureaucrat
